      <description>Recap In a previous post I proposed a statistical model to estimate whether the 2024 Chicago DNC affected public transit usage across Chicago.&#xA;The learning objective was to was to try to construct a believable model from a real-life event &amp;ndash; or to convince myself that the model is too flawed to be trustworthy.&#xA;I gathered ridership data for train, bike, and rideshares, plus the dates and locations of the DNC.</description>

      <description>This research project asks:&#xA;Does the exogeneous shock of the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago induce significant impacts on public transit usage?&#xA;In a previous post, I collected Chicago open transit data and designed a quasi-experiment to measure the causal impact of the DNC on ridership.&#xA;Regression Now for the results &amp;hellip;&#xA;Fixed Effects Model The fixed effects specification conveniently eliminates static sources of bias without needing to explicitly measure each and every static variable (in other words it controls for all time-invariant unobserved factors).</description>

      <description>View app on Observable Cloud&#xA;This was an interview take-home project. The prompt was &amp;ldquo;Make a dashboard for a school district leader, comparing standardized test scores (3rd grade reading level meets grade level) to household income and poverty at the zip code level. Don&amp;rsquo;t do statistical analysis.&amp;rdquo; Links were provided to school-level test scores, school locations, and zip-level Census ACS data.&#xA;Features Search by zip or school district name. Find similar communities based on economic factors (k nearest neighbors).</description>

      <description>527 Explorer Network visualization of ProPublica&amp;rsquo;s 527 Explorer, built with Observable Framework.&#xA;Demo (so far &amp;hellip;)&#xA;Why make this? This project is in part, an extension of my prior research into nonprofit donations networks.&#xA;I would like to write my own opinionated d3.js layout that deals with the scale-free and core-periphery characteristics of these networks. Having code to query and visualize a donations dataset was a first step.&#xA;I also have ambitions to create better looking interactive visualizations, and was curious by the interactivity provided by Observable.</description>

      <title>Do Democrats Really Support Public Transit?</title>
      <link>https://eric-mc2.github.io/projects/dnc-effect/</link>

      <description>A few weeks ago I fumbled an interview question on statistical modeling. That hurt my pride, so I decided to take on a little modeling project.&#xA;With all the local hubbub around the DNC security perimeter, I remember mostly staying home to avoid getting snarled in traffic. This got me wondering how the rest of the city responded to the convention. How did the visiting delegates fare? Did they use public transit?</description>

      <title>Chicago Transit Ridership Panel</title>

      <description>This page describes the steps I took to create a panel dataset of ridership across different Chicago transit systems. I did this to practice econometric modeling.&#xA;Transit modes and data sources Included modes&#xA;Train, Bus, Rideshares - from the City of Chicago (used Socrata API and sodapy python package) Bikeshares aka Divvy Bikes - from Lyft (used s3fs python package to access public Amazon S3 bucket) Excluded modes&#xA;Metra commuter rail (public data is available but too coarsely aggregated) Pace city-suburb bus link (have not checked availability) Walking / Biking (vendored data is available &amp;ndash; ie cell phone location data &amp;ndash; but would be hard to isolate from other transit modalities) Driving (public data is available &amp;ndash; ie road segment usage &amp;ndash; but haven&amp;rsquo;t seriously looked yet) Extra data</description>
