      <description>A few weeks ago I fumbled an interview question on statistical modeling. That hurt my pride, so I decided to take on a little modeling project.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll follow the standard economic practice of creating a quasi-experiment out of a policy implemented with some randomness.&#xA;I exploit the exogeneous shock of the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, (ie. the addition of tens of thousands of politically active Democrats) to test whether a statistically significant change in public transit is observed.</description>

      <description>This page describes the steps I took to create a panel dataset of ridership across different Chicago transit systems. I did this to practice econometric modeling.&#xA;Transit modes and data sources Included modes&#xA;Train, Bus, Rideshares - from the City of Chicago (used Socrata API and sodapy python package) Bikeshares aka Divvy Bikes - from Lyft (used s3fs python package to access public Amazon S3 bucket) Excluded modes&#xA;Metra commuter rail (public data is available but too coarsely aggregated) Pace city-suburb bus link (have not checked availability) Walking / Biking (vendored data is available &amp;ndash; ie cell phone location data &amp;ndash; but would be hard to isolate from other transit modalities) Driving (public data is available &amp;ndash; ie road segment usage &amp;ndash; but haven&amp;rsquo;t seriously looked yet) Extra data</description>
