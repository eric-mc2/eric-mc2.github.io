    <p>Project link: <a href="https://github.com/eric-mc2/DNCTransit">https://github.com/eric-mc2/DNCTransit</a></p>
    <p>A few weeks ago I fumbled an interview question on statistical modeling. That
hurt my pride, so I decided to take on a little modeling project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll follow the standard economic practice of creating a quasi-experiment
out of a policy implemented with <em>some</em>
randomness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I exploit the exogeneous shock of the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, (ie. the addition of tens of thousands of politically active Democrats) to test whether a statistically significant change in public transit is observed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supposing this setup is statistically valid (FOOTNOTE), I expect public transit
ridership to <em>increase</em> due to the DNC. This is because the Democratic coalition
generally lives in urban areas, supports &ldquo;green&rdquo; policy, government spending, etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong></em>: I don&rsquo;t really have a stake in whether Democrats in general use transit or not,
but I like this setup for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>if <em>NO</em> effect is found, that is also interesting
<ul>
<li>it suggests a gap between talk and action in the Democratic leadership</li>
<li>(in most experiments null results are boring)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the premise is kinda click-baity</li>
<li>if the setup is not statistically valid, I can practice demonstrating that too
<ul>
<li>(poorly tested statistics can have lasting effects on society!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="at-first-glance">At First Glance</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://cdn.choosechicago.com/uploads/2024/10/TE-DNC-Impact.pdf">report</a>
says 50,000 delegates visited and spent $58.7M within Chicago off-site of the convention itself.
This would be a small blip in city-wide average daily CTA ridership (800,000).</p>
<p>But we know convention event is localised to the United Center and McCormick place.
When we only look at CTA routes serving this part of the city, the average
daily ridership reduces to 325,000. An influx
of 50,000 riders would mean a 15% day-over-day increase in this area.</p>
<p>Breaking this down further, daily ridership for nearby bus routes and train lines
is 136,000 and 189,000.
Selecting only nearby train <em>stations</em> (similar data is not available for bus <em>stops</em>),
average daily boardings are 11,000. To round out this picture,
there are 6,000 and 33,000 average daily bike and rideshare
trips in areas near the United Center and McCormick place.</p>
<p>With these totals in mind, I&rsquo;d expect the DNC delegation to significantly increase
ridership nearby the convention centers, no matter what transit mode they choose.</p>


<div id="/json/avg-daily-rides.json" class="plotly" style="height:500px;"></div>
<script type="module">
    import {plot as plotlycustomplot} from "/js/plotly_custom.js";
    d3.json("/json/avg-daily-rides.json")
        .then(fig => plotlycustomplot(fig, "\/json\/avg-daily-rides.json"));
</script>
<h1 id="the-data">The data</h1>
<p>I have <a href="../transit-panel/index.html">constructed a panel dataset</a> of transit ridership among train (CTA), bus (CTA), rideshare (uber, lyft, etc), and bikeshare (Divvy). The original public data is published at
varying spatial aggregations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Train: per station</li>
<li>Bike: per station</li>
<li>Bus: per route</li>
<li>Rideshares: per tract / community area</li>
</ul>
<p>First I&rsquo;ll create separate models per transit type. Then I&rsquo;ll model train,
bike, and rideshares jointly at the tract level, since I&rsquo;m interested in
comparative/substitution effects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though busses serve the most
riders, I will leave them out, since I can&rsquo;t further disaggregate the route-level data.
Routes that pass near the DNC still extend for miles beyond it.</p>
<h2 id="points-of-interest">Points of Interest</h2>
<p><strong>Convention Centers</strong></p>
<p>I use the City of Chicago buildings shapefile to find the footprint of the
United Center and McCormick Place, the two official sites of the DNC. Proximity
to these locations will constitute the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group in the model.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I compute a buffer around each building and find all intersecting transit stations, routes, and tracts.
For robustness, I computed 400m, 800m, and 1600m buffers. To pick which catchement size to use, I was forced to choose
one mile buffer, because the smaller sizes had too few intersecting stations and routes.</p>
<p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/panel_sample.jpeg" alt="Bus ridership is not known per stop.">
    <figcaption>Fig: Transit serving convention areas.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>
<p>To test the sensitivity of the buffer, I modeled:</p>
$$\text{rides}_i \sim \text{within 400m}_i + \text{within 800m}_i + \text{within 1600m}_i$$
<p>Average rides per spatial unit varied irregularly as the buffer size increased,
meaning results will be very sensitive to the choice of buffer size.</p>
<p><strong>Community Areas</strong></p>
<p>One problem with spatial intersects is that it will include areas that barely
touch the buffer. This is not terrible for tracts: 50% of tract area is actually
contained within the buffer. For the much larger Chicago community areas, only
25% of intersected area is within the buffer.</p>
<p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/comms_sample.jpeg" alt="Intersected community areas">
    <figcaption>Fig: Intersected community areas</figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d wanted to use the community area aggregation because it contains about 30% more
uber rides that were redacted at the tract level. But widening the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo;
area this much is going to bias a statistical model towards showing zero effect.</p>
<p>As a robustness check, I will run a model excluding tracts that barely touch
the buffer.</p>
<h2 id="time-like-features">Time-like Features</h2>
<p><strong>Conference Dates</strong></p>
<p>The DNC itself occurs between August 19-22. This constitutes the &ldquo;treatment period&rdquo;
in the model. For a robustness check I will consider extending this period by
1 or 2 days (travel/tourism days). I may also run the model with random placebo
dates, or perhaps dates aligned with major concerts such as Lollapalooza, Suenos Festival, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Day of the Week</strong></p>
<p>Commuting patterns have strong weekday/weekend polarity. CTA ridership is drastically
higher on weekdays, while on weekends Uber ridership is higher. I&rsquo;ll need to control
for this in the regression.</p>


<div id="/json/scaled-ts.json" class="plotly" style="height:500px;"></div>
<script type="module">
    import {plot as plotlycustomplot} from "/js/plotly_custom.js";
    d3.json("/json/scaled-ts.json")
        .then(fig => plotlycustomplot(fig, "\/json\/scaled-ts.json"));
</script>
<h2 id="other-spatial-features">Other Spatial Features</h2>
<p><strong>Transit Density</strong></p>
<p>For the tract-level dataset, I coded the distance to the nearest train, bus, and bike stop.
These distances will help control for varying tract size, commercial density, and
transit mode preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
<p>I include the stop/tract centroid longitude and latitude as a quadratic
term in the model to help control for basic city-wide demographic factors:</p>
$$
\sim \beta_1\text{lon} + \beta_2\text{lat} + \beta_3\text{lon}*\text{lat} + \beta_4\text{lon}^2 + \beta_5\text{lat}^2
$$
<p>(For numeric stability, I scale lon/lat to zero-mean unit variance.)</p>
<h2 id="spatial-aggregation">Spatial Aggregation</h2>
<p><strong>Train Stops -&gt; Lines</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the CTA does not publish the number of <em>exits</em> per station, so
I cannot directly count the number of <em>arrivals</em> to the DNC by train.</p>
<p>I considered aggregating station <em>boardings</em> along each <em>line</em>, but decided against
it for the same reason I am excluding bus data.</p>
<p><strong>Stops -&gt; Tracts:</strong></p>
<p>This is straightforward. Stops cannot belong to more than one tract.</p>
<p>(You might argue that stops should be represented as cirles, not points, because
people walk to them. Therefore we should attribute rides to tracts within those circles.
To keep things simple I will not go to this level of detail.)</p>

<h1 id="the-sample">The Sample</h1>
<p><strong>Weekends</strong></p>
<p>Since the DNC itself only occurs during weekdays, it is perfectly co-linear with
a weekday variable, breaking the regression procedure. To fix this co-linearity
problem, I will drop observations on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from the model.
(Ridership on these days doesn&rsquo;t convey any information about the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo;
because the DNC doesn&rsquo;t even happen on these days.)</p>
<p>For this same reason, I use <em>daily</em> observations. Aggregating the data to weeks
would include extraneous variance due to weekends. It would also <em>attenuate</em> the
treatment effect since the DNC only occurs on 4/7 days of the week &ndash; the other
3/7 days would require correcting for &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_average_treatment_effect#Non-compliance_framework">noncompliance</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Baseline Dates</strong></p>
<p>I use data from the summer months, June, July, and August. Restricting the data
to this set makes sense for two reasons. First, I avoid needing to incorporate
more complex modeling of seasonality. Second, transit has been on a long-term
rebound since the pandemic, which is less noticeable on short time-scales:
I avoid needing to incorporate a parameter to account for this long-term trend.</p>
<p><strong>Boardings vs Trips</strong></p>
<p>CTA train and bus data only provides the locations where riders <em>board</em> transit,
not where they <em>exit</em>. Bike and rideshare data provides per-trip board <em>and</em> exit
locations. For strict parity, I&rsquo;d want to only consider trip <em>boarding</em> locations, but
I&rsquo;d rather keep the trip exits which give a fuller picture of transit usage. In this scheme,
bike and rideshare data are double-counted compared to train and bus: this
isn&rsquo;t an issue for regression as the difference in scale will be absorbed
by adding a &ldquo;transit mode&rdquo; coefficient.</p>

<p>We can see that the two groups are quite different before the DNC week. I will
circle back to this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Power</strong></p>
<p>Before running the regression, I want to do a <em>slightly</em> more rigorous version
of the time series <a href="#at-first-glance">gut check</a>. First, I&rsquo;ll look at the distribution of
daily ridership and ask: what is the minimum number of additional rides to
significantly change the mean? In math,</p>
$$ \text{MDE} = (z(1-\alpha / 2) + z(\beta)) \sigma $$

</div>
<p>This table is saying the tracts near DNC serve a daily average of 925 uber rides.
That average would need to spike by an additional 438 rides to be statistically significant.
Which equates to 1.4 rides per DNC attendee over the course of the event &ndash; less than one round trip.</p>
<p>Corraborating the first <a href="#at-first-glance">time series plot</a>, it looks like the event should be statistically detectable if
most attendees are commuting.</p>
<h1 id="regression">Regression</h1>
<p>Finally!</p>
<h2 id="fixed-effects-model">Fixed Effects Model</h2>
<p>The fixed effects specification is great when you don&rsquo;t have enough control variables.
It controls for all the ways that units are different at baseline &ndash; all
time-invariant variables.</p>
<p>The equation would look like:</p>
$$ \log(\text{rides}_{it}) \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{DNC}_t + \beta_2 t + \alpha_i $$
<p>The convenience of FE is also its downside: the qualities of my treatment group and even
the treatment &ldquo;indicator&rdquo; (distance to DNC) do not vary with time. These factors
get subsumed in the unit fixed effect term \(\alpha_i\).
Without being able to isolate the <em>area</em> of the DNC, this equation only shows city-wide
effects during the DNC.</p>
<p>With this major caveat in mind, let&rsquo;s run the model (separate models per transit mode):</p>

<p>The results show that at compared to the rest of Chicago, the DNC areas are
more heavily transited on Uber and bikes and less on trains. They agree directionally
with the fixed effect model: that Uber and train ridership drops city-wide during the DNC
by roughly similar percentages. And most importantly, they show that ridership
in areas near the DNC during the DNC increases by a huge 18%, 68%, and 24%.</p>
<h1 id="todo">TODO:</h1>
<p><em>This blog post isn&rsquo;t finished!</em> I still have to write-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>checking model assumptions
<ul>
<li>e.g. parallel trends in diff-in-diff</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>robustness checks</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-you-shouldnt-trust-this">Why you shouldn&rsquo;t trust this</h1>
<p><strong>Control Mis-Specification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the control group should be &ldquo;like&rdquo; the treatment group, but I use the entire
city as a comparison. it&rsquo;s not apples-to-apples. a better control group might
be a handful of the major event/cultural institutions like Soldier Field,
Wrigley Field, Guaranteed Rate Field, Art Institute. or finding matched pairs
based on covaraites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Selection Bias</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the convention centers were explicitly chosen for their ability to accomodate visitors via transit
<ul>
<li>i don&rsquo;t think this is bad because we dont really need external validity. we don&rsquo;t actually
expect other sites in Chicago to have a similar response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spillover into control</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DNC visitors might stay in chicago longer than the official convention dates,
which would attenuate any effect
<ul>
<li>we can mitigate this by using placebo dates or by an event study design</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNC visitors may visit other parts of the city, attenuating the effect
<ul>
<li>we can mitigate this by maybe searching for spikes in other areas
(but introduces a multiple testing issue)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spillover into treatment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>drawing buffers around the event centers weakens our identification strategy
(marginally nearby transit might be spuriously related to the DNC itself)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Confounding Variables</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the security perimeter around the event centers may actually suppress ridership
<ul>
<li>we can mitigate this by drawing larger buffers, but this weakens our identification strategy
(transit outside the perimeter might be spuriously correlated)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gravity and Catchement Models</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A real urban mobility researcher would probably use some kind of diffusion
model, saying that rider origins are normally distributed around each station.
This might be more realistic but I don&rsquo;t have the capacity to estimate and
incorporate this kind of complexity.</li>
