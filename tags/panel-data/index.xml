      <description>Recap In a previous post I proposed a statistical model to estimate whether the 2024 Chicago DNC affected public transit usage across Chicago.&#xA;The learning objective was to was to try to construct a believable model from a real-life event &amp;ndash; or to convince myself that the model is too flawed to be trustworthy.&#xA;I gathered ridership data for train, bike, and rideshares, plus the dates and locations of the DNC.</description>

      <description>This research project asks:&#xA;Does the exogeneous shock of the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago induce significant impacts on public transit usage?&#xA;In a previous post, I collected Chicago open transit data and designed a quasi-experiment to measure the causal impact of the DNC on ridership.&#xA;Regression Now for the results &amp;hellip;&#xA;Fixed Effects Model The fixed effects specification conveniently eliminates static sources of bias without needing to explicitly measure each and every static variable (in other words it controls for all time-invariant unobserved factors).</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I fumbled an interview question on statistical modeling. That hurt my pride, so I decided to take on a little modeling project.&#xA;With all the local hubbub around the DNC security perimeter, I remember mostly staying home to avoid getting snarled in traffic. This got me wondering how the rest of the city responded to the convention. How did the visiting delegates fare? Did they use public transit?</description>
